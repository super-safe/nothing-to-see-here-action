You probably don't even remember why you added this Action to your repo.

Regardless, this Action's maintainer abandoned this repo ages ago and didn't notice when
I, the great [tricky-seal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), took over
their account. I have force-pushed a bare history to this project and retagged the
1.2.3 release tag to my own malicious version.

Let this be a lesson to you all! Hash-pin your Actions or beware!
